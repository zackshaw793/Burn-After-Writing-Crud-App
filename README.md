Burn after writing is a crud application that uses a mock json server to store data. When the repo is cloned you will have to run the server with the CLI.

The documentation on the server can be found here.

The project is meant to be a journaling application that will eventually post a prompt to users each day, after
which the user will write their prompt and the post will be deleted after 48 hours. 

It is meant to embody the idea of writing something down on a piece of paper and burning it.
